            "I'm an aspiring developer with a passion for tackling new challenges and continually learning. I'm motivated by personal growth and the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the projects I'm part of.", 
            "Currently, I'm pursuing my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Networks at CNAM (National Conservatory of Arts and Professions) in Paris, France. I've delved into topics like AI, Operations Research, and Computer Architecture, and I'm excited to expand my knowledge even further.", 
            "Alongside my studies, I've gained hands-on experience in both customer service and marketing, where I've been able to bridge the gap between technology and real-world applications. At Fidelity Investments, I worked closely with a mentor from the tech department on Java-based projects. During my time at AIESEC in France, I built a program that connected to our organization's GraphQL API to automate data management tasks like updating spreadsheets.",
            "In my down time, I love to explore Paris, make music, snowboard, travel, and work on coding projects."
